The FFV representation is an instantaneous-frame representation of variation in fundamental
frequency, and is intended to model at the sub-unit level intonation trajectories, in the same
way that standard MFCC features model formant trajectories at the sub-unit level.

This representation was introduced in

[1] Kornel Laskowski, Jens Edlund, and Mattias Heldner (2008), "An Instantaneous Vector
Representation of Delta Pitch for Speaker-Change Prediction in Conversational Dialogue Systems". In
proceedings of the 33rd IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing
(ICASSP2008), Las Vegas NV, USA, 30 March - 04 April, pp5041-5044,

and an overview is available in

Variation Spectrum". In proceedings of the 21st Swedish Phonetics Conference (Fonetik 2008),
Gothenburg, Sweden, 11-13 June, pp29-32.

Several computational refinements are described in

./ffv [ --fs FS ] \
	[ --tfra TFRA ] \
	[ --tint TINT ] [ --text TEXT ] [ --tsep TSEP ] [ --winShape WINSHAPE ] \
	[ --fbFileName FBFILENAME ] \
	[ -- dcorrxformType DCORRXFORMTYPE ] [ --nOutput NOUTPUT ] \
	INFILENAME
	[ OUTLOCNAME ]

----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7----+----8----+----9----+----0

	General Parameters:

FS : input-file sampling frequency, in Hertz (default value: 16000)
TFRA : desired frame step, in seconds (default value: 0.008)

----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7----+----8----+----9----+----0

	Windowing Parameters:

TINT : width of window function from peak towards the center of the two-window frame
	(default value: 0.011)
TEXT : width of window function from peak away from the center of the two-window frame
	(default value: 0.009
TSEP : separation between peaks of the two window functions (default value: 0.014)
WINSHAPE : one of
		- "hamming_hamming"
		- "hann_hann"
		- "hamming_hann"
	where "a" in the "a_b" format above indicates the internal edge of the window function and
	"b" indicates the external edge (defalt value: "hamming_hann")

----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7----+----8----+----9----+----0

	Filterbank Parameters:

FBFILENAME : name of file specifying filterbank parameters, including
		- duration of instant over which variation is measured (TSEPREF)
		- granularity of FFV spectrum sampling (NINPUT)
		- number of filterbank filters (NFILTER)
		- individual filter structure (FILTER)
	See filterbank.sample1 for the filterbank definition which is the default filterbank
	when the fbFileName option is left unspecified.

----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7----+----8----+----9----+----0

	Decorrelation Parameters:

DCORRXFORMTYPE : one of
		- "data"
	(default value: "data")

NOUTPUT : integer number of post-transform outputs to retain (default: all)

----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7----+----8----+----9----+----0

	Filenames:

INFILENAME : name of RIFF wave file; however, the header is not parsed. the following
	characteristics are assumed:
		- two-byte (16bit), signed (two's complement) integer samples
		- no compression, little-endian encoding
		- single channel
	the header is assumed to be 44 bytes long, and is skipped.

OUTLOCNAME : optional output location. output is written to an OUTFILENAME created in
	the following way:
	1. if OUTLOCNAME is specified, and the file system object is absent,

		OUTFILENAME = OUTLOCNAME.

	2. if OUTLOCNAME is specified, the file system object is present, and is a directory,

		OUTFILENAME = OUTLOCNAME . "/" . INFILENAME . ".txt"

	   if OUTFILENAME already exists, the program aborts.

	3. if OUTLOCNAME is specified, the file system object is present, and is not a
	   directory, the program aborts.

	4. if OUTLOCNAME is not specified,

		OUTFILENAME = INFILENAME . ".txt"

	   if OUTFILENAME already exists, the program aborts.
